# Python Basics â€” Practice Questions

Practice foundational Python programming concepts including input/output, conditional statements, loops, functions, and string manipulation.

## Contents

### 1. Data Types & Input/Output

**Task**:

- Divisible by **3**
- But **not divisible by 5**

---

### 4. Functions

**Task**:  
Write a function named `is_prime(n)` that checks whether the given number is a prime number.  
Then:
- Ask the user to input **three numbers**
- Use the function to check each number and print whether it's prime
